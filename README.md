### 1. Purpose of Declaration

The inventors hereby declare the opening of an integrated technological system designed to achieve the sustainability of the global environment as a common heritage of humanity.

This technology, based on natural laws and sustainable principles, implements the Four Fundamental Principles of Human Survival (Providence, Harmony, Circulation, Structure) and is released not for the benefit of any specific individual, corporation, or nation, but for the future of all life on Earth.

-----

### 2. Overview of the Invention

This invention consists of the following integrated environmental regeneration technology groups:

#### 2.1 Ocean Breathing System

**Principle:**
By injecting air into the deep sea layer (250m depth), artificially assists the lost vertical circulation and transports nutrients to the surface layer. This activates phytoplankton and dramatically improves CO2 fixation capacity.

**Innovation:**

- Octahedral platform (integrated solar, wind, and tidal power generation)
- Spiral outlet (10x mixing efficiency)
- Fully autonomous operation
- Manufacturing cost: $16,500/unit (mass production)
- CO2 fixation: 5 tons/year/unit

**Effects:**

1. Elimination of dead zones
1. Dramatic improvement in CO2 absorption
1. Marine ecosystem recovery
1. Climate stabilization

#### 2.2 Urban Environment Improvement System

**Components:**

- Humus production facility (resource utilization of food waste and fallen leaves)
- Urban soil conversion (rooftop and wall greening integration)
- Water circulation infrastructure (seawater desalination, purification and reuse)
- Distributed energy (vertical axis wind power generation)

**Effects:**
Cities themselves become carbon sinks, mitigate heat island effects, and ensure water and energy autonomy.

#### 2.3 Integrated Effects

Through the integration of both systems:

- Ocean: Restore breathing across 70% of Earth’s surface
- Land: Reconstruct circulation across 30% of Earth’s surface
- Result: Regeneration of Earth’s overall metabolic function

-----

### 3. Reasons for Opening

#### 3.1 Urgency

Global environmental problems are a survival crisis for all humanity.

The remaining time is approximately 5 years (2025-2030). Considering the time lag (20-30 years), if we don’t act now, we won’t make it by 2050.

Rapid implementation takes priority over the profit pursuit of any individual or corporation.

#### 3.2 Universality

Since this technology is based on natural laws and sustainable principles, it is applicable not to specific regions but to the entire Earth.

#### 3.3 Developability

Through opening, researchers, engineers, and practitioners worldwide can improve and develop it. Evolution through collective intelligence reaches the optimal solution fastest.

#### 3.4 Ethics

Technology based on natural providence should be the shared wisdom of humanity. Nature belongs to no one—it belongs to all life.

-----

### 4. Terms of Use

This invention is available under the following conditions:

#### 4.1 Free Use

- **Free to use for research, development, and implementation**
- Including commercial use
- No permission required
- No usage fees
- Credit notation recommended (not mandatory)

#### 4.2 Sharing Improvements (Strongly Recommended)

- Improved versions are strongly recommended to be opened as well
- However, not mandatory
- Sharing improvement information accelerates overall evolution

#### 4.3 Prohibited Acts

The following acts are explicitly prohibited:

1. **Monopolization through patents**

- Monopolizing this technology or derivative technologies through patents is prohibited
- Defensive patents (to prevent monopolization by others) are permitted

1. **Use for environmental destruction**

- Using this technology for environmental destruction is prohibited

1. **Use for military purposes**

- Using this technology for direct military purposes is prohibited
- However, military use for environmental conservation is excluded

1. **Information concealment**

- Intentionally concealing implementation results of this technology is prohibited
- Sharing data, including failures, is requested

-----

### 5. Inventors’ Rights

The inventors reserve the following:

#### 5.1 Attribution of Original Concept

Record and recognition that the original concept of this technology belongs to the inventors.

#### 5.2 Ethical Oversight Rights

The right to publicly express opinions on clearly inappropriate uses (environmental destruction, military use, etc.).

#### 5.3 Right to Participate in Improvements

The right to wish to participate in improvement projects (not mandatory).

#### 5.4 Honor Rights

Honor as inventors and the record of their achievements.

-----

### 6. Rights Waived by Inventors

The inventors explicitly waive the following:

#### 6.1 Patent Rights

Waive all patent rights related to this technology.

#### 6.2 Exclusive Implementation Rights

Waive the right to exclusively implement this technology.

#### 6.3 Right to Claim Monetary Benefits

Waive the right to claim monetary benefits such as usage fees and license fees for the use of this technology.

#### 6.4 Claims on Improved Versions

Do not claim rights to improved versions by others.

-----

### 7. Implementation Requests

The inventors strongly request the following from those who receive the technology:

#### 7.1 Rapid Pilot Testing

Not just theory, but actual implementation and verification should be conducted rapidly.

#### 7.2 Data Publication

Openly share implementation results (both successes and failures).

#### 7.3 International Cooperation

Build cooperative systems across borders.

#### 7.4 Respect for Nature

Respect natural laws and sustainable principles in implementation, minimizing environmental impact.

#### 7.5 Inheritance to Next Generation

Inherit this technology and philosophy to the next generation and build a sustainable civilization.

-----

### 8. Disclaimer

#### 8.1 No Warranty

The inventors provide no warranty regarding the effectiveness, safety, or suitability of this technology.

#### 8.2 Limited Liability

The inventors are not responsible for damages arising from the use of this technology. Users assume all responsibility.

#### 8.3 However

This disclaimer does not exempt intentional falsehood or gross negligence by the inventors.

-----

### 9. Revisions

This declaration may be revised under the following conditions:

- Revisions by inventors: According to technological progress
- However, the basic spirit (opening, sharing, environmental conservation) remains unchanged

-----

### 10. Conclusion

**This technology was not “thought up.”**

**I simply saw the structure that should exist.**

-----

Nature already has the answer.

Humanity only needs to remember it and implement it.

-----

This declaration is for the future of all life on Earth.
